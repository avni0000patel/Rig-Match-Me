# Rig-Match-Me
In this project we have created an application that provides a guided tour of instruments to help steer the user towards getting properly setup for the genre of music they are interested in playing. The application prompts the user to signup for an account if they don't have an account already or login to their existing account. Once logged in, the user can build their own rig and view previous rigs they have created. This application uses npm dependencies including express, express-handlebars, express-session, MySQL2, sequelize, dotenv, bcrypt, axios, connect-session-sequelize and nodemailer.
